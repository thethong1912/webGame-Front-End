			   <button class="accordion">Common terminology in headlines and articles Games mean?</button>
				<div class="panel">
				<p><span style="color: blue;">On the title, you will often see the following terms: </span><br><br>
				<span style="color: darkred;">Game Of The Year:</span>
			 Service is the game of the year, usually the game have included the full range of DLCs. For details of the DLCs, then would you please read the owner<br><br>
			 <span style="color: darkred;">Ultimate Edition:</span>
			 Same as above, it also includes the DLCs<br><br>
			<span style="color: darkred;">Completed:  </span>

			Same as above, it also includes the DLCs<br><br>
			<span style="color: darkred;">Watting for crack : </span>

			No crack. Often, the game underwent the protective layer as DENUVO, EAC will need a long time to crack. If you see this word in your game site, I guarantee 100% no other place you can play games for free it all. So do not waste time and risking your computer to try elsewhere.
			<span style="color: blue;">In the article, you'll see the following terms:</span><br><br>
			<span style="color: darkred;">GOG: </span><br><br>
			It was understood as one type of game copyright -- Classified such errors can not crack the game.<br><br>

			<span style="color: darkred;">DLCs or DLC : </span><br><br>

			As the expansion pack of the game, often additional new game screen, new functions or new items<br><br>
			<span style="color: darkred;">Update :</span><br><br>

			 As an upgrade. Often when Game Update mostly to fix bugs in the game. There are errors we see and have mistakes we can not see.<br><br>

			<span style="color: darkred;">PROPER :</span><br><br>

			 Can be understood as mother cooked rice preparation, usually groups attached to crack the game name (or crack) of them to assert that is almost perfect and error free classifieds. Also PROPER also a function in Microsoft Excel (not related).
<br><br>
			<span style="color: darkred;">3DM :</span><br><br>

			 A group of Chinese Crack and Crack only this group has its own website. Crack team game can be said to be "three" for the time before 2014. Usually the game is played 3DM finished unpacking immediately, there will be one of the few private Crack comes to Fix Errors.<br><br>

			<span style="color: darkred;">DENUVO : </span><br><br>

			The protective layer against Crack Game three directors from 2014 to the present! With the beginning of the launch, it was pretty sketchy Denuvo which had "difficult" not less grouping cracker. After the first few upgrades, it has become really DENUVO three directors when making 3DM be declared "pause crack game" when they give up with Just Cause 3. Until 2017, it has only 3 groups (individual) cracker can beat absolutely DENUVO.<br><br>

			<span style="color: darkred;">CPY :</span>
<br><br>
			 A Crack group oldest Italian (Italy). This is the group cracker first cracked the game using the protective layer Denuvo (as at Denuvo finishing) and the present (fall 2017), this group has officially finishing tool crack dedicated Denuvo so , the game was Denuvo protected "drop" stations very quickly. So we can say that this is the best group of three islands cracker today and now they just focus on their neatly closed "care" Denuvo. Usually located in the folder crack crack .
<br><br>
			<span style="color: darkred;">BALDMAN : </span><br><br>

			The nickname of one exceptional individuals, appeared in mid-2017 tested with Denuvo and BALDMAN won with 2 games debut as Nier & Sniper Ghost Elite 3 with crack temporarily called "BALDMAN v1 ".However, v1 has many problems arise as a crash occurs, bug, freeze, together with denuvo upgraded version of" harder ", but only after v2 then" BALDMAN v3 "then" he "has full victory Denuvo perfectly. After This exercise, he stopped work to crack the game with the confession, "I have achieved my goals, go towards CPY because they are heading cracker highest peak, wait for them to complete the tool and back again".
			<br><br>
			<span style="color: darkred;">Steampunks : </span><br><br>

			Like BALDMAN, this new name appeared in 2017. "They" had written his own on the table "Denuvo Cracker". Up to now, the speed of the crack "they" have to say is on par with the CPY and also "care" Special Denuvo. This is one group or just one individual excellence? It still is one big question mark in the world of celebrities and the underworld!<br><br>

			<span style="color: darkred;">CODEX : </span><br><br>

			According to unofficial information, the groups are separated from SKIDROW out. Private Folder crack usually located in CODEX and new game also automatically copy the crack after installation. Especially in this group is hard Crack all the new games that are not protected by DENUVO.<br><br>

			<span style="color: darkred;">PLAZA: </span><br><br>

			A subgroup of CODEX. Crack the game because this particular group comes. The old game we have to crack by hand - that is put in the game folder Copy after installation. Private Folder crack usually located in PLAZA. These new games later, its installation process allows us to automatically copy the box after installing Crack always.<br><br>

			<span style="color: darkred;">PROPHET : </span><br><br>

			Game is often accompanied by multiple languages. Crack often located in the folder PROPHET own.<br><br>

			<span style="color: darkred;">FLT (FAIRLIGHT): </span><br><br>

			A Crack oldest group. Now the group is no longer active. Their game has its own Crack comes and we have to crack craft. Crack is typically located in the folder Fairlight<br><br>

			<span style="color: darkred;">RAZOR1911:  </span><br><br>

			Must say this group is the old guard within the Cracker. Was founded in 1985 and has been a lot of game Crack ago. Now the group is no longer active. Their game has its own Crack comes and we have to crack craft. Crack is typically located in the Folder RAZOR1911.<br><br>

			<span style="color: darkred;">RELOADED:  </span><br><br>

			Appears after RAZOR1911 not long and they have proven their talent by Crack the popular games of the past. Personal opinion is more stable Crack RELOADED Crack many other groups. Games usually come separately and have to Crack Crack vs crafts. Usually located in the folder Crack RELOADED.<br><br>

		

			A crack team tied vs blockbuster titles. Until the present time for the group at their Crack Crack and Fix often go back many times Fix. For his personal vs present their Crack Crack is most unstable. Fix Fix constantly go all the crap bugs. Game of this group and we have to Crack Crack own crafts. Usually located in the folder Crack SKIDROW<br><br>

			This is one of the groups that you mistook Crack it Own Website the most. Actually the sites you find on Google is all fake. Even that famous anymore Website only because followers, just because the name given to the group website. Personal vs me, I have to vs vendettas that the Website. They take advantage of the reputation for personal gain.<br><br>

			Affirm always, in addition to not have any 3DM Crack team is there own website. Forging socks. Invite you to watch Youtube videos children Common Virus for more details.<br><br>

			The remaining groups are similar Crack nghen. What is the group name, the crack in the folder with the name of that group. Do not be mistaken vs groups REPACK<br><br>

			<span style="color: darkred;">REPACK: </span><br><br>

			Game duly Repack the game SUPER FULL - SUPER should or also known as FULL RIP. Repack games and different game RIP it. Do not be mistaken offline.<br><br>

		

			FULL game Game Repack is compressed for easy during the download and storage. It only compression to reduce storage only and eliminate unnecessary language as goofy ship, french etc .. not undercut anything. FULL RIP is also new medium has reduced quality compression too (almost all k now also rip anymore).<br><br>
		

			Often the original game of the group Crack, Update and DLC every time we have to install it manually and Crack again. Repack longer, set one full release is always no need to install anything.<br><br>
